(b)	those surveys were conducted over a time frame appropriate to the taxon's life cycle and life form, in known or expected habitat and at appropriate times (diurnal, seasonal, annual)."

Without limiting the generality of primary criterion 2.1, this primary criterion is met if— (a)	exhaustive surveys throughout the taxon's historic range fail to record an individual member of the taxon; and (b)	those surveys were conducted over a time frame appropriate to the taxon's life cycle and life form, in known or expected habitat and at appropriate times (diurnal, seasonal, annual).

Subcriterion 3.1.2: The taxon's geographic distribution is extremely restricted and at least 2 of the following circumstances apply— (a) the distribution of the population or habitat of the taxon is severely fragmented or restricted to a limited number of threat-based locations; (b)there is a continuing decline or reduction in any one of the following— (i) extent of occurrence; (ii) area of occupancy; (iii) area, extent or quality of habitat; (iv) number of locations or subpopulations;  (v) number of mature individuals; (c) there are extreme fluctuations in any one of the following— (i)	extent of occurrence; (ii) area of occupancy; (iii) area, extent or quality of habitat; (iv) number of locations or subpopulations; (v) number of mature individuals. Subcriterion 3.1.3 The taxon's estimated total number of mature individuals is very low and evidence suggests that— (a) the number will continue to decline at a very high rate; or (b) the number is likely to continue to decline and any one of the following apply— (i) each subpopulation is extremely small; (ii) most of the individuals are in one subpopulation; (iii) extreme fluctuations occur in the number of mature individual members. Subcriterion 3.1.4 The taxon's estimated total number of mature individuals is extremely low. Subcriterion 3.1.5 The probability of the taxon's extinction in the wild is extremely high in the near future, based on a quantitative analysis."

VIC,Vulnerable,Vulnerable,"The taxon of flora or fauna is vulnerable. Subcriterion 5.1.1 The taxon has undergone, is suspected to have undergone or is likely to undergo in the immediate future a substantial reduction in population size.
Subcriterion 5.1.2 The taxon's geographic distribution is restricted and at least 2 of the following circumstances apply— (a) the distribution of the population or habitat of the taxon is severely fragmented or restricted to a limited number of threat-based locations; (b) there is a continuing decline or reduction in any one of the following—	(i) extent of occurrence; (ii) area of occupancy; (iii) area, extent or quality of habitat; (iv) number of locations or subpopulations; (v) number of mature individuals; (c)there are extreme fluctuations in any one of the following— (i) extent of occurrence; (ii) area of occupancy; (iii) area, extent or quality of habitat; (iv) number of locations or subpopulations; (v) number of mature individuals.

VIC,Conservation Dependent,Conservation Dependent,"Primary criterion 6.1 The taxon of fish is the subject of a plan of management that provides for management actions necessary to stop the decline, or support the recovery, of the taxon to maximise its chances of long-term survival in nature and the cessation of the plan of management would adversely affect the conservation status of the taxon. Primary criterion 6.2 The taxon of fish is the focus of a specific conservation program the cessation of which would result in the species becoming vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered."
