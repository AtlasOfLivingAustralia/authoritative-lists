state,sourceStatus,Status,Notes - NT follows IUCN but has extra categories in their data which have been included
NT,Ex,Extinct,"A species is extinct when there is no reasonable doubt that the last individual has died. To call a species extinct, there must have been surveys carried out to look for the species across its previously known range. The survey needs to also consider the life cycle of the species and the times of year when it might be located there."
NT,Ew,Critically endangered (possibly extinct),"A species is critically endangered when all the evidence shows that the species meets at least one of the IUCN criteria A to E for critically endangered. It is then at an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild. In cases where a species may be extinct but where not all surveys have been done to show the species absence, the species may be classified in a possibly extinct subcategory. These species are considered threatened in the NT."
NT,CE,Critically endangered,"A species is critically endangered when all the evidence shows that the species meets at least one of the IUCN criteria A to E for critically endangered. It is then at an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild. In cases where a species may be extinct but where not all surveys have been done to show the species absence, the species may be classified in a possibly extinct subcategory. These species are considered threatened in the NT."
NT,EN,Endangered (extinct in NT),"A species is extinct in the wild when it is known only to survive in cultivation, in captivity or as a naturalised population/s outside the range they once lived in. Calling a species needs for there to have been similar surveys to those done for extinct species."
NT,EN,Endangered (extinct in wild in NT),"A species is extinct in the wild when it is known only to survive in cultivation, in captivity or as a naturalised population/s outside the range they once lived in. Calling a species needs for there to have been similar surveys to those done for extinct species."
NT,EN,Endangered,"A species is endangered when all evidence shows that it meets at least one of the IUCN criteria A to E for endangered species, indicating it is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild. These species are considered threatened in the NT."
NT,Vu,Vulnerable (extinct in NT),"A species is vulnerable when all the evidence shows that it meets at least one of the IUCN criteria A to E for vulnerable, indicating that it is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild. These species are considered threatened in the NT."
NT,Vu,Vulnerable,"A species is vulnerable when all the evidence shows that it meets at least one of the IUCN criteria A to E for vulnerable, indicating that it is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild. These species are considered threatened in the NT."
NT,NT,Near Threatened,"A species is near threatened when it is not classified in one of the above threatened categories, but it is close to being or is likely to be in a threatened category soon."
NT,LC,Least concern (extinct in NT),"A species is least concern when there is sufficient information available to make an assessment and it is not classified as critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable or near threatened. Species that are widespread with high numbers are in this category."
NT,LC,Least concern,"A species is least concern when there is sufficient information available to make an assessment and it is not classified as critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable or near threatened. Species that are widespread with high numbers are in this category."
NT,DD,Data Deficient,"A species is data deficient when there is not enough information to make a direct, or indirect, assessment of its risk of extinction based on distribution and/or population. Data deficient is not a category of threatened species, but data deficient species should not be assumed to be safe. A species in this category may be well studied and well known but there is not enough specific data on numbers and distribution. Species in this category need more information and future research will probably show that they need to be classified as threatened."
NT,NE,Not Evaluated,A species is not evaluated when it is has not been assessed against the criteria. This may be because the species is a rare visitor to the Territory or that the taxonomy of the species has recently changed or is unclear.
