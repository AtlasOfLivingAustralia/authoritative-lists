QLD,EX,Extinct,A species is classed as extinct if there is no reasonable doubt the last member of the species has died.
QLD,PE,Extinct in the wild,"A species is classed as extinct in the wild if: the wildlife is known only to survive in cultivation, in captivity or as a naturalised population well outside its past range; or it is not known to survive in its known or expected habitat, in its past range, over a period appropriate to the life cycle or form of the wildlife."
QLD,CR,Critically endangered,"A species is classed as critically endangered if: the wildlife has undergone or is suspected to have undergone a very large reduction in numbers; or it is likely that a very large reduction in the wildlife’s numbers is imminent; or
the wildlife’s geographic distribution is precarious for the survival of the wildlife and very restricted; or the estimated total number of mature individuals is very low and it is likely the number will continue to decline at a very high rate, or continue to decline, and its geographic distribution is precarious for the survival of the wildlife; or the estimated total number of mature individuals is extremely low; or the probability of the wildlife’s extinction in the wild is at least 50% in the immediate future."
QLD,E,Endangered,A species is classed as endangered if: the wildlife has undergone or is suspected to have undergone a large reduction in numbers; it is likely that a large reduction in the wildlife’s numbers is imminent; the wildlife’s geographical distribution is precarious for the survival of the wildlife and restricted; the estimated total number of mature individuals is low and it is likely the number will continue to decline at a high rate or continue to decline and its geographical distribution is precarious for the survival of the wildlife; the estimated total number of mature individuals is very low; the probability of the wildlife’s extinction in the wild is at least 20% in the near future.
QLD,V,Vulnerable,A species is classed as vulnerable if: the wildlife has undergone or is suspected to have undergone a moderate reduction in numbers; it is likely a moderate reduction in the wildlife’s numbers is imminent; the wildlife’s geographical distribution is precarious for the survival of the wildlife and limited; the estimated total number of mature individuals is limited and it is likely the number will continue to decline at a substantial rate or continue to decline and its geographical distribution is precarious for the survival of the wildlife; the estimated total number of mature individuals is low; the probability of the wildlife’s extinction in the wild is at least 10% in the medium-term future.
QLD,NT,Near threatened,"A species is classed as near threatened if: the population size or distribution of the wildlife is small and may become smaller, or the population size of the wildlife has declined, or is likely to decline, at a rate higher than the usual rate for population changes for the wildlife, or the survival of the wildlife in the wild is affected to an extent that the wildlife is in danger of becoming vulnerable (as defined above) native wildlife may also be classed as near threatened if they are the subject of a threatening process."
,SL,Special least concern,"The criteria for declaring a species as least concern are if: the wildlife is common or abundant and is likely to survive in the wild. Native wildlife may be prescribed as least concern wildlife even if: the wildlife is the subject of a threatening process; or
the population size or distribution of the wildlife has declined; or there is insufficient information about the wildlife to conclude whether the wildlife is common or abundant or likely to survive in the wild. The Governor in Council may classify a species as least concern by amending the Nature Conservation (Animals) Regulations 2020 where the above criteria under the Nature Conservation Act 1992 have been met. All animals previously listed as Common are now listed as Least Concern. All plants, birds, reptiles and amphibians indigenous to Australia, other than those that are extinct, extinct in the wild, critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable or near threatened wildlife, are least concern wildlife.
