# CONSERVATION CODES		
For Western Australian Flora and Fauna 		
(last updated 3 January 2019)		
		
Threatened, Extinct and Specially Protected fauna or flora1 are species2 which have been adequately searched for and are deemed to be, in the wild, threatened, extinct or in need of special protection, and have been gazetted as such. 		
The Wildlife Conservation (Specially Protected Fauna) Notice 2018 and the Wildlife Conservation (Rare Flora) Notice 2018 have been transitioned under regulations 170, 171 and 172 of the Biodiversity Conservation Regulations 2018 to be the lists of Threatened, Extinct and Specially Protected species under Part 2 of the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016. 		
		
Categories of Threatened, Extinct and Specially Protected fauna and flora are:		
		
# T	- Threatened species	<br>
Listed by order of the Minister as Threatened in the category of critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable under section 19(1), or is a rediscovered species to be regarded as threatened species under section 26(2) of the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 (BC Act). 

**Threatened fauna** is that subset of ‘Specially Protected Fauna’ listed under schedules 1 to 3 of the Wildlife Conservation (Specially Protected Fauna) Notice 2018 for Threatened Fauna.

**Threatened flora** is that subset of ‘Rare Flora’ listed under schedules 1 to 3 of the Wildlife Conservation (Rare Flora) Notice 2018 for Threatened Flora.

The assessment of the conservation status of these species is based on their national extent and ranked according to their level of threat using IUCN Red List categories and criteria as detailed below. <br>

	CR	Critically endangered species
Threatened species considered to be “facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the immediate future, as determined in accordance with criteria set out in the ministerial guidelines. 

Listed as critically endangered under section 19(1)(a) of the BC Act in accordance with the criteria set out in section 20 and the ministerial guidelines.  

Published under schedule 1 of the Wildlife Conservation (Specially Protected Fauna) Notice 2018 for critically endangered fauna or the Wildlife Conservation (Rare Flora) Notice 2018 for critically endangered flora.

	EN	Endangered species 
Threatened species considered to be “facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild in the near future, as determined in accordance with criteria set out in the ministerial guidelines.  

Listed as endangered under section 19(1)(b) of the BC Act in accordance with the criteria set out in section 21 and the ministerial guidelines.  

Published under schedule 2 of the Wildlife Conservation (Specially Protected Fauna) Notice 2018 for endangered fauna or the Wildlife Conservation (Rare Flora) Notice 2018 for endangered flora.

	VU	Vulnerable species
Threatened species considered to be “facing a high risk of extinction in the wild in the medium term future, as determined in accordance with criteria set out in the ministerial guidelines. 

Listed as vulnerable under section 19(1)(c) of the BC Act in accordance with the criteria set out in section 22 and the ministerial guidelines.  

Published under schedule 3 of the Wildlife Conservation (Specially Protected Fauna) Notice 2018 for vulnerable fauna or the Wildlife Conservation (Rare Flora) Notice 2018 for vulnerable flora."

##	**Extinct Species** <br>
Listed by order of the Minister as extinct under section 23(1) of the BC Act as extinct or extinct in the wild. 	

	EX	Extinct species
Species where “there is no reasonable doubt that the last member of the species has died”, and listing is otherwise in accordance with the ministerial guidelines (section 24 of the BC Act).  

Published as presumed extinct under schedule 4 of the Wildlife Conservation (Specially Protected Fauna) Notice 2018 for extinct fauna or the Wildlife Conservation (Rare Flora) Notice 2018 for extinct flora. 

	EW	Extinct in the wild
Species that “is known only to survive in cultivation, in captivity or as a naturalised population well outside its past range; and it has not been recorded in its known habitat or expected habitat, at appropriate seasons, anywhere in its past range, despite surveys over a time frame appropriate to its life cycle and form”, and listing is otherwise in accordance with the ministerial guidelines (section 25 of the BC Act). 

Currently there are no threatened fauna or threatened flora species listed as extinct in the wild.  If listing of a species as extinct in the wild occurs, then a schedule will be added to the applicable notice. 

##	**Specially protected species** <br>
Listed by order of the Minister as specially protected under section 13(1) of the BC Act.  Meeting one or more of the following categories: species of special conservation interest; migratory species; cetaceans; species subject to international agreement; or species otherwise in need of special protection.

Species that are listed as threatened species (critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable) or extinct species under the BC Act cannot also be listed as Specially Protected species.

	MI	Migratory species
Fauna that periodically or occasionally visit Australia or an external Territory or the exclusive economic zone; or the species is subject of an international agreement that relates to the protection of migratory species and that binds the Commonwealth; and listing is otherwise in accordance with the ministerial guidelines (section 15 of the BC Act).

Includes birds that are subject to an agreement between the government of Australia and the governments of Japan (JAMBA), China (CAMBA) and The Republic of Korea (ROKAMBA), and fauna subject to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (Bonn Convention), an environmental treaty under the United Nations Environment Program.  Migratory species listed under the BC Act are a subset of the migratory animals, that are known to visit Western Australia, protected under the international agreements or treaties, excluding species that are listed as Threatened species. 

Published as migratory birds protected under an international agreement under schedule 5 of the Wildlife Conservation (Specially Protected Fauna) Notice 2018.

	CD	Species of special conservation interest (conservation dependent fauna)
Fauna of special conservation need being species dependent on ongoing conservation intervention to prevent it becoming eligible for listing as threatened.  

Published as Specially Protected under the Wildlife Conservation Act 1950, in Schedule 6 of the Wildlife Conservation (Specially Protected Fauna) Notice. 

	OS	Other specially protected fauna
Fauna otherwise in need of special protection to ensure their conservation, and listing is otherwise in accordance with the ministerial guidelines (section 18 of the BC Act). 

Published as other specially protected fauna under schedule 7 of the Wildlife Conservation (Specially Protected Fauna) Notice 2018.

# P	- Priority species  <br>

Possibly threatened species that do not meet survey criteria, or are otherwise data deficient, are added to the Priority Fauna or Priority Flora Lists under Priorities 1, 2 or 3.  These three categories are ranked in order of priority for survey and evaluation of conservation status so that consideration can be given to their declaration as threatened flora or fauna. 
 
Species that are adequately known, are rare but not threatened, or meet criteria for near threatened, or that have been recently removed from the threatened species or other specially protected fauna lists for other than taxonomic reasons, are placed in Priority 4.  These species require regular monitoring. 

Assessment of Priority codes is based on the Western Australian distribution of the species, unless the distribution in WA is part of a contiguous population extending into adjacent States, as defined by the known spread of locations.

	Priority 1: Poorly-known species 
Species that are known from one or a few locations (generally five or less) which are potentially at risk.  All occurrences are either: very small; or on lands not managed for conservation, e.g. agricultural or pastoral lands, urban areas, road and rail reserves, gravel reserves and active mineral leases; or otherwise under threat of habitat destruction or degradation.  Species may be included if they are comparatively well known from one or more locations but do not meet adequacy of survey requirements and appear to be under immediate threat from known threatening processes.  Such species are in urgent need of further survey.

	Priority 2: Poorly-known species 
Species that are known from one or a few locations (generally five or less), some of which are on lands managed primarily for nature conservation, e.g. national parks, conservation parks, nature reserves and other lands with secure tenure being managed for conservation.  Species may be included if they are comparatively well known from one or more locations but do not meet adequacy of survey requirements and appear to be under threat from known threatening processes.  Such species are in urgent need of further survey.	
  
	Priority 3: Poorly-known species
Species that are known from several locations, and the species does not appear to be under imminent threat, or from few but widespread locations with either large population size or significant remaining areas of apparently suitable habitat, much of it not under imminent threat.  Species may be included if they are comparatively well known from several locations but do not meet adequacy of survey requirements and known threatening processes exist that could affect them.  Such species are in need of further survey.	

	Priority 4: Rare, Near Threatened and other species in need of monitoring
  
(a) Rare.  Species that are considered to have been adequately surveyed, or for which sufficient knowledge is available, and that are considered not currently threatened or in need of special protection, but could be if present circumstances change. These species are usually represented on conservation lands.

(b) Near Threatened.  Species that are considered to have been adequately surveyed and that are close to qualifying for Vulnerable, but are not listed as Conservation Dependent.

(c) Species that have been removed from the list of threatened species during the past five years for reasons other than taxonomy."	
		
1 The definition of flora includes algae, fungi and lichens		
2 Species includes all taxa (plural of taxon - a classificatory group of any taxonomic rank, e.g. a family, genus, species or any infraspecific category i.e. subspecies or variety, or a distinct population).
